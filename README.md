# WebSocket Chat

This is a sample websocket powered chat. It requires Node.js and PHP on the server side.

Installation is really easy and only requires the **ws** package for Node.js. One may install it using **npm**.

```
npm install ws
```

Check the *settings.json* file in order to make changes to host, port as well as SSL settings.

The file *wschat.conf* is a sample upstart script for Ubuntu.
